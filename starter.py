"""Assignment 1 - linear regression from scratch.

Standard library only: no numpy, no pandas, no scikit-learn.

Fill in the four functions below. Keep the names and signatures exactly as they are - the
grading tests import them by name. See README.md for what is assessed.

Your two short answers go at the bottom of this file.

def solve_linear_system(A, b):
    """Solve `A z = b` by Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting.

    Args:
        A: an n x n matrix, as a list of n rows (each a list of n floats).
        b: the right-hand side, a list of n floats.

    Returns:
        The solution vector `z`, a list of n floats.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if `A` is singular (no unique solution exists).

    Hint: work on a copy of the augmented matrix. For each column, find the row with the
    largest absolute value in that column (the pivot), swap it up, then eliminate the
    entries below it. Finish with back-substitution.

           function adds the intercept itself.
        y: a list of n outcome values.

    Returns:
        A list of p + 1 coefficients: [intercept, b_1, ..., b_p].

# SHORT ANSWERS (3-5 sentences each - see README.md)
#
# 1. Why does partial pivoting matter numerically, and what goes wrong without it?
#
#    <your answer>
#
# 2. Your fit fails on a design matrix containing both `area_in_sqm` and `area_in_sqft`.
#    Explain why in terms of X'X, and say what you would do about it.

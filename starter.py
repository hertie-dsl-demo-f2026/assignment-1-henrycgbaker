# SHORT ANSWERS (the model answers, for marking)
#
# 1. Partial pivoting swaps the row with the largest absolute value in the current column
#    into the pivot position before eliminating. Elimination divides by the pivot, so a
#    pivot that is small relative to the other entries multiplies existing rounding error
#    by a large factor, and that error then propagates through every subsequent row and
#    through back-substitution. Without pivoting the algorithm also fails outright on a
#    perfectly solvable system whose leading entry happens to be exactly zero - the
#    division is by zero even though a unique solution exists. Pivoting costs one scan per
#    column and bounds the growth factor, which is why every production solver does it.
#
# 2. `area_in_sqft` is an exact multiple of `area_in_sqm`, so one column of the design
#    matrix is a linear combination of another and X has linearly dependent columns. Then
#    X'X is singular: its determinant is zero, no inverse exists, and infinitely many
#    coefficient vectors give exactly the same fitted values, so the estimator is not
#    identified. Numerically the elimination hits a pivot at machine-epsilon scale and
#    either raises or returns wild coefficients that are meaningless individually. The fix
#    is to drop one of the two columns - they carry identical information - or, if the
#    collinearity is approximate rather than exact, to regularise (ridge adds lambda*I to
#    X'X, which restores invertibility) and to report that the individual coefficients are
#    not separately interpretable.
